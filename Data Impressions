While observing the joined column, members named Nick joined on different dates 6/29/2017 and 9/1/2015. This could be an error or two different Nicks joined at different times. This could also mean the member Nick joined and left in 2015 and rejoined in 2017. If the member_name column stated the last name of each member, this could narrow down the possibilities.*/
