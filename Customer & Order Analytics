--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

    COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT
   COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT 
    DISTINCT product, 
    MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT 
    product, 
    SUM(quantity)*ROUND(price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
