--This SQL project involves normalizing the LetsMeetData by removing redundant columns. Normalization helps eliminate data duplication and improve data integrity, resulting in a more
efficient and organized database structure for managing meeting-related information.

-- Eliminate Redundant Columns
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    venue_
LIMIT 5;

ALTER TABLE venue_
DROP COLUMN `RAND()`,
DROP COLUMN localized_country_name,
DROP COLUMN phone;

/*RAND() is a function that returns random numbers, this column has no use in the venue_ table. Localized_coutry_name is a duplicate of country column. Phone column the values are incomplete.*/

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    city
LIMIT 5;

ALTER TABLE city
DROP COLUMN localized_country_name,
DROP COLUMN distance,
DROP COLUMN country;

/*Removing localized_country_name column and country column, they're redundant and they're also located in other tables.
Distance column is uninformative in the city table.*/

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    event
LIMIT 5;

ALTER TABLE event
DROP COLUMN headcount,
DROP COLUMN why;

/*Removing headcount column because it's uninformative, most values are zero. Why column is uninformative as well and most values are null*/

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    category
LIMIT 5;

ALTER TABLE category
DROP COLUMN shortname,
DROP COLUMN sort_name;

/*Removing shortname and sort_name columns, both columns are redundant to one another, category_name displays the same names from both columns.*/

-- 3 Split grp_member table
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    grp_member
LIMIT 5;

-- A  Creating new table called group_sign_ups
CREATE TABLE group_sign_ups AS SELECT DISTINCT group_id, member_id, joined FROM
    grp_member;

SELECT
	*
FROM 
	group_sign_ups
LIMIT 5;

-- B Creating new table called members
CREATE TABLE members AS SELECT DISTINCT member_id, member_name, city, hometown, member_status FROM
    grp_member;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    members
LIMIT 5;

-- C PRIMARY KEY
ALTER TABLE members
ADD PRIMARY KEY(member_id);

DESCRIBE members;

-- D FOREIGN KEY
ALTER TABLE group_sign_ups
ADD FOREIGN KEY(member_id) REFERENCES members (member_id);

DESCRIBE group_sign_ups;

ALTER TABLE group_sign_ups
ADD FOREIGN KEY(group_id) REFERENCES grp (group_id);

-- E DROP grp_member table
DROP TABLE grp_member;
